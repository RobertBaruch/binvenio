# Binvenio

An Android app for keeping track of your home/hobby inventory.

You print QR codes on stickers and stick them to items and
containers -- even shelves, closets, and rooms! The app keeps
track of what item/container goes with which QR code, and helps
you find an item you're looking for.

It also keeps track of how many of an item you have, and if you
are tracking the location of books, has a handy ISBN barcode
scanner which will enter the title for you.

Your data is stored locally on your phone. If your phone is set
to back up apps and their data, your data will be backed up
along with any other apps and data. There is no capability to
share data.
